Reference ground truth F0 files used for the resynthesis of the database with the PAN engine.
The F0 curves have been obtained by analyzing the original 16kHz audio files using the CREPE algorithm with the provided default model (the "full capacity" version).
Then, those curves have also been transposed 1 octave down and 1 octave up.
